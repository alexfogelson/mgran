Folks what it is really about. More than anything, all of the radical left, most ardent proposals are dress there all expensive dresses built on the back of an incredibly prosperous system, saying tax, the rich all signalling all it is his arm of the person because, like i believe that it would be a bad person if she just wants to make our and say tax, the return of that, but it say, tax. The rich are the back. So now good person now virtuous caravan wearing a stupid bib. They probably caused a couple wearing, say it if, in events had anything, just think look at these decadent idiot celebrities, but she had embroider on it peggy the patriarchy, and that means that shit he is a morally praiseworthy person, megan repeal would just be a wine soccer player playing a sport that very few people. At once, every four years when the media decided important and then why about a salary contract that she herself signed. All she would be, except for the fact that she walked around talking about how victimized she is an american society and how the institutions are bad, the greatest drift in america is living on the back of the greatest system ever put to paper. And then talking about what a victim you are well living high on that system is the most amazing gripped ever seen, and so many of our politicians do it. Does it joe biden never taken a private sector paycheck. Hey joe biden has never any business turbines never done. Anything worthwhile is in the was elected to the senate of the united states when he was twenty nine years old. You say congressional welfare case in here. Talking about the evils of the system that have me worth millions and millions of dollars and by the way that system, the political patronage system. It made a millions and millions of dollars, because why rich sheet a difference between politicians? before and then going to politics and people who are not rich. Men became rich because they were politicians like joe biden, just kind of despicable, the the amazing spectacle in the united states of people who benefit from the system really the system for pay and fun is just an amazing amazing thing to walk, and you should always keep that in mind, because what doing because what is that really mounted in the end? what a man who is they are better than you. They are more morally praiseworthy. Then you you see, elsie is more morally praiseworthy, then you, you are just arrest sure you, somebody who owns a small restaurant indiana and you know you think the institutions should be torn down. Have the vision, melick, economics cunning. You see the deep roots of evil in the system, while you know getting ten million, no attacks from from jack dorsey for twitter, and running a centre for antiracist research that today has produced zero research of boston university. The person who runs business and tries to make the employees have money to take home and you try to put food on the table for kids in. Maybe you try to service your customers, but you stand up against the institutions, which means that your bad and stupid these both their special their elite. They are better than you because they have only succeeded in the system. They recognise the evils of the system, and this makes them superior to you and what what it really means that we are just supposed to ignore everything they actually do on the ground in favour of the proposition that you are bad and you are. You are morally blameworthy. Your life does not matter your your prospects. Do not or your hopes in your dreams do not matter because you are not part, because playing revolutionary brigade, because you like a dog they actually caught the car. They know what to do with it. It really is these rules, if tom ford, and timothy charlemagne and eo see if ever caught the car and the instituted socialist revolution. Apparently so ardently see it may be quite unhappy with the result most ardent communists in the united states, who never lived under communism and most ardent capitalists in the united states have. There is a for that reason, the cuban expertise, come to the united states and they understood the evils of communism, while all the communists in the united states were born in the united states, went to our top universities and an again it comes down way that they are going to to re in green still reinforce. Own sense of moral superiority is to crap on you bringing and it comes out in you think they do, it really does take, for example, covered power. They will get to that in just one moment, because marathons are still trap.

Can you heard already not gonna, do that a daily work? we think the federal government has the authority to do any of this. For this we could face up to fourteen. Dollars for every single violation which could destroy us, which is why we are taking them to court and we are calling on you for europe. Support.

Enough is enough, so please stand with us at the daily, where with the rights of all american citizens? in listening to the largest fastest growing conservative pakistan radio show in the nation himself. General marbella. Remember. He is part of the bureaucracy that one lovely, a fire by now going to lose their jobs for incompetence so long as they carry out he wishes of democratic president, so we have watched in extraordinaire botched operation, afghanistan, general mobility, it is kind of amazing. The mark milly called up the chinese. We show them that we will do anything that offended their tender sensibilities while trump was president. Meanwhile, mark million the entire pentagon was working with them. Administration to make nice with the taliban. Really just wonderful and apparently droning randalls sets excite. As well ran. Paul asked state tony blinkin yesterday about does because, on the way out of afghanistan, after the isis k attack, which is like a special care vices attack on american troops in afghanistan, while they were trying to accurate vote, your recovery. After that, on the way out, there was a drone attack by the military and accord. There are times we basically held an afghan translator and many members of his family, including children, ran paul, asked secretary of state twenty blink you have any idea we droned and lincoln nope so question is getting fired for that and what does it take to get fired, depended on and if kinda fired, whose actually and control the real question. Maybe it when a democratic president the answer is the democratic presidencies and control the one republican president is president, then bureaucracy is in control? there is centre ran with tony blinkin, the guy the biden administration droned worker or an ices k operative. The administration is, of course, reviewing that that craig and i am sure that a full assessment will be well before you know if those in aid worker or an ice is cooperative operative. I speak too that i can speak to that in the setting. In any event, so you know, i tell us, i i dont know because peruvian see you gotta know before you off somebody with a predator drown. Yes sure leggy yeah, ten harder. You with me. Well tony blinking, keep saying we you this coming! so then, why are you still working? why are you so? in office, and the answer is because of your part of the democratic blob you can is your job for pretty much any reasons other than just kind of offending the president, but other than that you gonna stay there forever no matter how in company you are and then went offs that can fire any these career staff. Just gonna, keep him there because of you, keep him there, then going to fill those gaps. Answer is elected the next republican president. Needs to clean house, and i mean mass firing. I mean everybody goes, i mean this place gets shut down top to bottom. There is so harry state enable it we had no idea by the way everybody knew whose watching this for five seconds. This is going to happen. If you did this way, you did it a genius to figure this out our like five years ago, in which the first chapter is this happening. It because i was watching afghanistan closely, because it is patently obvious to anybody that if you withdraw all support for the afghan military in hand, the country back to the taliban ban crap was of our ears. Tony blinking, being an idiot we, the intelligence community, did not say that the country wide collapse of all meaningful resistance would be likely to occur in a matter of days. And any reference stub, german millions. I did earlier nothing saw that i saw that we saw suggested that this government, and a security force would collapse in a matter of eleven days and right that i think we need to look back at all of this oh, you need look back at all this better been fire. Will anybody be fired? josh holly is asking that question yesterday. He said going to slow walk, joe biden, foreign policy nominees until the top officials, who this lose their jobs. He said, gonna jack to confirming nominees for state and offence. I you know, concerns unless anthony blinking, lloyd, often secretary vents, in i say to examine all resign because they take responsibility for their failures, but the thing none of them are gonna resign, because their failures are not their own. Their joe biden failures and if they happened under president from they would have observed obstructing trumps palace, and then from had fired than there has been a hue and cry. The trunk was getting rid of career officials to undemocratic, get rid of career officials or termed officials. No big deal in biden recently attempted to fire a bunch of trump appointees to soar. Non partisan boards in a very and of his administration included some folks like kelly makin any but are also included some some people like lieutenant general. It was like a general. My master and bind was like. I like you from the train fire you, even though you actually have terms riot. These are not viable positions, in opening the made seem to care very much about that norms. Only exist when they can be used as a club against republicans all going to break the country really is by the way are intelligent, photo leggings fire bees. Apparently, intelligence which all qaeda could reform inside it. Just then they originally said it could reform. Within one to two years but apparel ok is already there, which we already knew. So well done everybody. The reason that i keep coming back to this decentralizing point about the administrative bureaucracy is because, if the country breaks is going to be because people there is no incentive structure for people to stay structure, you have to give people something if you want them to remain inside a structure that takes forty percent of their money. Thirty percent of the money and restricts every area of their life there. Me some guarantee on the other end and the guarantee on the other end cannot simply be that people you disagree with, going to govern every aspect of life is people are seeing movement to read states as an escape we are seeing it as a way of a boy. Blue state governance there. There for treason, the sorting is happening and if he response by the democrats and their friends in the bureaucracy is to tighten their grip to harden their defences. Become more school erotic, to become less responsive to cut off all the feedback, loops, gonna break the thing you are and that is the direction that we are moving right now on everything from defence to afghanistan to covert i did the attempts to take rip. Everything incredibly tightly are going to lead to lasorda once had the coachman baseball team is sort of like holding a doubt your whole to tighten up the dove does escape you dont want to hold it so tightly crushed it up. He could say that your government is sort of the same thing at the goal of the federal government should be too strong enough to maintain the union, but not strong enough to actually destroy the union and it seems as though we are moving very rapidly in the direction of strong enough to destroy the union and rather crush the dog. Then then allowed it up to breed a little bit. And these are predictable results. That is not enough that the title you grip them are things get a break? not creating stability are actually creating radical instability. In this entire process, now radical instability is going to lead to a lot of very bad things. Not going to lead to an amicable ethical what break up like days? i just know nothing it an amicable, amicable divorce. The high likelihood is that things get uglier as time goes on. Because in a desire for top down dominant your normally there would be an ad here, but using an you find this site useful, please consider disabling your or everybody when they have no place left to go because you are using federal government as the cramped, power through the power. An unelected administrative bureaucracy. The only track, apparently being supreme court, mean we now have two branches of the american government administrative state and the supreme court and net it, and if the democrats simply packed the supreme court, that check goes away. To then, i will say that the end of the american republican experiment would would then be at an end, depressing note, have additional hour of the bench.

Artists in the united states are cosplay revolution. They actually won revolution. Really want much anything beyond simple me. Moral virtue, signalling about how little they like this. Under which they have grown written venice. So they do? is they hobnob with one another and they re fancy parties and they were very fancy clothes and they talk dedicated they are to the revolution? do the thing actual revolutionary? you kill people who go to the mad cow. If you are looking at the old school communist revolution, you go to the towers palace anymore, him in his family. If looking at the french revolution, the sounds glow they go over to the royal and they execute them, but they dont do is go to the party with the royal and then, where slogans that say down with the royals, because then it just looks frankly like your kind of a tool, and in fact that is what the met why is it a bunch of marxist cosplay marxism? it is a bunch of radicals, costly radicalism, not actually being radical. They are not actually going and protesting that gala. In fact, i think what what is so funny about this is their cosplay two things at once. One is there cosplay revolution. Look at us. We are shut. Look. We are fighting the patriarchy by doing this event on behalf of the michaela to raise money for institution, the metropolitan museum of art is over a hundred years and is an institution largely step by men and also we are fighting capitalism, wearing these expensive gowns and these expense have tuxedos made by companies that reagan money, but they also put slogans on those damn it. I mean revolutionaries so that hassling revolution, but they are also cosplay marxist think capitalist. Are it amazing? i know lots extraordinarily rich people. I know no billionaires, i know multi billion years. I know some of the richest people on earth and let me tell you they live like the people at the met gal address the people at the met. Gala want you to think it is what capitalist live like, but the only people who live like this are the people at michaela. It is these celebrities who spend their night dressing like fools, in thousand dollar gowns that look like a child made them in art class. An incredible thing, and so gotta love a gala because it exposes them for the frauds they are in famous ethnic essay by tom off. It is maybe the best political, i say of all time called radical sheikh. About it. It was really printed in york magazine is about a party at at leonard bernstein house, the party was leonard bernstein and his then wife, and they get or in a penthouse with a bunch of black panthers, is as a cover story for new york magazine and the whole thing is hysterically funny, because it is a bunch of up crust. Radical left us who have benefited from the systems of the united states, patronising the black panthers, who show up telling them how white pigs should be killed and all the way you are clapping for them, rather than the entirety of the esa, while the owing to her between radical sheikh that tom wolf essay and what have, miguel every year is that they are acting. Not even bringing in the black panthers. There are actually bring in a new radicals. There even bring anybody in to act, is sort of like the the exhibits at the they can staring with those of the radicals. We love them factually pretend to be them. It is there. A letter, burnings dinner party leonard seen her dressed up as a black panther and then declared himself brave for doing so, and that is what the miguel is every single year and an astonishing, i mean really is, and so we saw a lot of that last night they will save the best for last because we have to, but it began with folks like megan repeal showing up and make an appeal shows up wearing a a rare. White and blue outfit and holding a small it in gay. We trust z has not got it in its engaged. We trust you see, like is the theme as american fashion is nothing says. Respect from colleague, replacing god with gay mitchell such a revolutionary megan, were pinochet, is standing up to the patriarchy every single she standing up to the patriarchy by making money from the patriarchy and appealing for the help of male politicians. Instead, all day long whining about her position as a very weak, the white woman who gets to pay sport that no one watches other than every four years. And be a social activists that has not actually achieved so exciting subjects but elite he trusts in gay. Exciting and gaily, dressed as we had megan repeal and they may occur the line, and i am i maybe screwing up an amber. Frankly, i care because i really know very much. She is apparently she some sort of model, and here she was modeling a baby, slash straitjacket. I know what this top is supposed to be, and it has pegged at the patriarchy o, the curry. Oh, the stunning courage and bravery peg, the patriarchy, because pegging, of an obscure sexual practices in which women perform the the the more aggressive sexual act on men peg at the patriarchy right. Which yeah and if taking the patriarchy by being model for the pleasure of men generally speaking and also pegging the patriarchy by wearing scantily, clad outfits that say this and the patriarch is quaking in it. But let me tell you just have been well the courage you not by the way where the patriarchy is actually dominant. Using woman could wear this so in afghanistan, now a is pretty dominant if carol of delivery, walked out on the streets of afghanistan, she would be dead within approximately twenty two seconds because she live in patriarchy. The thing she lives in a free republic. No, but pegged the patriarchy such courage and met gala of all places. We should not have been doing it like a truck stop in ohio doing it the met gala, where the patriarchy lives, unbelievable courage. Stunning bravery. No, more of this in just one second, because it is indicative of the culture gap that has more in the united states in that actually has basically divided the country. Everybody in the end, the intelligentsia at its economics that divides america, economics is not about americans, everybody seems to but its policy that divides americans, in some cases, its policy, but more than that it is this cultural divide. We have half the country that believes that their politics, our valley, whose and that their values are better i actually believe they believe it had the courage to wear a thing that has pendulum pay directly to that gala or to wear or to take low percentage. In gay. We trust dynamite gala rebelling against the obviously deeply homophobic board of the met gala by the way they m in court. You rebelling against just wondering to whom are you chairs of the twenty twenty one met gala are with these charlemagne most recently was oscar nominated for playing a person, so much is still ok by the way lobby straighten plague, which, frankly, i dont understand that that seems like that violates all the structures that we have been told exist when it not allowed to act like a person not billy. Irish, obviously very homophobic, amanda, gorman, super homophobic, and i only osaka and tom ford is there an honorary chair as animals airy, anna or emmy? can you imagine a bigger levelled antigay bigotry than that? in the end, the courage of major european, oh walking up wearing an in gay. We trust person like unbelievable. There are costly revolution during its cost. Laying it is a mockery, so glad they do it. We do we get the best getting their guys hang on.

So fresh unbelievably face the face of freshness and the fresh, faceless elsie showed up to the michaela. Now nothing says, woman of the people like showing up geller, where the average ticket costs thirty thousand dollars. Nice sweden paper that i see that you are gifted the ticket by some in the management at the magala. She will a white dress from a actually was wondering who the maker of the dress was apparently the maker of the dress is some famous shoe designer does that mean cell dresses. Normally they made it special for her and she was wearing a special. I dress with a slogan on the back of it. Reading attacks the rich tax, the rich at the mat gala all of the rich people, including elsie, who makes a hundred seventy four thousand dollars. You not being a barmaid, but being a a person who is in congress mouthing often instagram. She is not enough, of the lower classes in the united states gang. Neither is bernie sanders. Bernie sanders is a millionaire loans. Three homes, ale, he is not a member of the blue collar working class any longer. I saw ass. He shows up to them a gala to hobnob, withdraw it there is no notice again. This has caused lang revolution. She outside yelling, people going into magala that they need to be taxed more, do not outside telling. Additionally giving all of the money not to the metropolitan museum of fashion, but to actual poor people let me tell you if you dont age, the metropolitan museum of art and money and go and the poor instead, the here here is that she is a heroine, its iconic. According to reports for rulings on iconic, ah is i search here. She is wearing this dress, as tax the rich and supposed to swoon, because can you not ass? you doing anything revolutionary going to a bunch of you. We agree with her about tackling the wretch, at least when their at events like this, and then they go home and ahead of their accountant. So what mustache my cash out on the text? how it actually works. In hollywood, a bunch of hollywood pirates, happy to pay is happy to pay the highest taxes at all the land, and then they call up. They called berman the accounting, like ok, figure out where stafford cayman islands without work, i dont headway avoid pink. The minimum i can pay. I noticed these people are not big on? actually the giving of the charity or the signing, a larger checks to the federal government have noticed, but has he decides to sharpen going to shame them shit that an analogy deeply ashamed they all look as though they have been just slap in the face of the whitefish or. Alternatively, they know that she just part of the game, because again, robespierre show up ever sigh wearing hello. It said kill the monarchs. He just killed the monarchs, if gonna be a revolutionary be revolutionary yoga, now would let them take crowd which but she is doing other stuff why do people this country who are suffering? who can go back to work in your city? you go back to work in a lot of places while the vaccine requirements district is one of these less wealthy districts in new york in here regular joe mansion was really bad dimension. Plutocrat your mansion? i see him at michaela. I did see this. This work into miguel there. She was gala hob nodding with oliver fashionable friends standing up to the patriarchy standing up to capital with all these beneficiaries of capitalism, core the mask of the red death at the ball that protects them from from being part of the so the pandemic its eye. It is, calling to say the least bourgeois down. I guess the dresses designer was aurora james and she went with her dress designer and she just what it means to be working class women of color at met. Yes, yes, wow! like cinderella going to the ball! yeah! we! u it well there. There was a cosy. She was sitting in her kitchen doing instagram post about how to make a smoothly, and she looked over. Into the fire and she just began sifting through the ashes for for potato a crumb to eat, and they began calling her ale cinderella. And ale. Cinderella then had billy porter arrive as the fairy godmother. And grants her her wish which was to go to the ball with all the special people wearing address that set on the back tax. The and then she turned back into a pumpkin should go back to washington dc and hang out with all the other pumpkins. So here she was. Blue collar elsie explaining her heroism, ah, not o heroes, where capes so where two thousand dollar dresses designed by aurora james here here, she is. When they were first kind of partnered military having conversation about what it means to be working class. Women, color at the mats amazon, you know we just play along. But we need to break the fourth wall and challenge some of the institutions, and you know why matt is known for its spectacle. We shut conversation about well, whether known about the spectacle. We should have a conversation about it. You know the are a hypocrite ass. A conversation were standing outside with design saying give all the money, the poor inside, having have effort, being gifted, give it a seat by the bat and partnered with aurora james who apparently, the creative directorate founder of luxury accessories brand called brother valleys, which, by the way, i should know brother valleys, just gonna renew some of the prices from their their website. Ok, brother valleys products, eminent look at their at their their shoes, right now. Ok, they have a trust scandal for to hunt an eighty five dollars. They have socks for eighty five bucks affair, which seems kind of expensive for socks. I will note jazz shoes the beirut slide for six hundred fifteen dollars, but these are working class women of color, fighting back against capitalism, the pedro so instead, i will explain why all these matters, because it really does it actually does the region of is you know what gets one second first, let us talk about the fact that you do not need to go the poster. Like possesses great, they ask me to go and weight in line, and you finally get to the friends and it takes forever. Otherwise, you need at home, why not just do it at home or due to the office. This is stamps dotcom thanks to stamp second have to go to the post office. You can mail anytime anywhere right from your computer and pay less a lot less. With this cancer rates. From u s p s, you ps and more clarity where we ve been used campsite com since twenty seventeen we have saved ourselves thousand. Thousands of dollars using stamps dotcom sam come, brings the services of the postal service and you ps directly to your computer. You simply use your computer to print official. U s, postage twenty four your mail is ready to schedule a pickup or drop it off. It is that simple, with stem cell colony, just council, forty percent of post office rates up to sixty six percent of european shipping rate not to mention stamps outcome, is a fraction of the cost of those expensive postage meters. So stop wasting time. Owing to the post office, go to stamp start com. Instead, there is no risk with my promo code shapiro, you get a special offer that includes before we try plus as digital scale, no long term commitments or contracts, just gotta stamps outcome, click on the microphone at the top of the homepage typing shapiro. That, since i come from a code, shapiro stem cell com never go to the post office again, so why does any of this matter michaela matter? what is a yo see in all this wise is important. The reason important is because this people who conference hearing them systems are the beneficiaries of the system, if do something like the michaela. It should be a celebration of capitalism because, frankly, what makes all of this past. It should be a celebration of free market and competition and creativity and entrepreneurship which is really what is happening at the regular. Instead, a bunch of master oratory idiots talking about how terrible are the systems under which we live well continuously living the highest on the haug. It is possible to live and making in the process, and you know what good, because it shows what idiots they are. It shows that for them, the political stance, like a purse, just an accessory. All political stance is not some sort of deeply rooted belief system for a lot of these votes. It is not what they believe in their heart of hearts, because they are willing to show that in order to go to a cocktail party with all the famous folks what it is really about. More than anything, all of the radical left, most ardent proposals are dress there all expensive dresses built on the back of an incredibly prosperous system, saying tax, the rich all signalling all it is his arm of the person because, like i believe that it would be a bad person if she just wants to make our and say tax, the return of that, but it say, tax. The rich are the back. So now good person now virtuous caravan wearing a stupid bib. They probably caused a couple wearing, say it if, in events had anything, just think look at these decadent idiot celebrities, but she had embroider on it peggy the patriarchy, and that means that shit he is a morally praiseworthy person, megan repeal would just be a wine soccer player playing a sport that very few people. At once, every four years when the media decided important and then why about a salary contract that she herself signed. All she would be, except for the fact that she walked around talking about how victimized she is an american society and how the institutions are bad, the greatest drift in america is living on the back of the greatest system ever put to paper. And then talking about what a victim you are well living high on that system is the most amazing gripped ever seen, and so many of our politicians do it. Does it joe biden never taken a private sector paycheck. Hey joe biden has never any business turbines never done. Anything worthwhile is in the was elected to the senate of the united states when he was twenty nine years old. You say congressional welfare case in here. Talking about the evils of the system that have me worth millions and millions of dollars and by the way that system, the political patronage system. It made a millions and millions of dollars, because why rich sheet a difference between politicians? before and then going to politics and people who are not rich. Men became rich because they were politicians like joe biden, just kind of despicable, the the amazing spectacle in the united states of people who benefit from the system really the system for pay and fun is just an amazing amazing thing to walk, and you should always keep that in mind, because what doing because what is that really mounted in the end? what a man who is they are better than you. They are more morally praiseworthy. Then you you see, elsie is more morally praiseworthy, then you, you are just arrest sure you, somebody who owns a small restaurant indiana and you know you think the institutions should be torn down. Have the vision, melick, economics cunning. You see the deep roots of evil in the system, while you know getting ten million, no attacks from from jack dorsey for twitter, and running a centre for antiracist research that today has produced zero research of boston university. The person who runs business and tries to make the employees have money to take home and you try to put food on the table for kids in. Maybe you try to service your customers, but you stand up against the institutions, which means that your bad and stupid these both their special their elite. They are better than you because they have only succeeded in the system. They recognise the evils of the system, and this makes them superior to you and what what it really means that we are just supposed to ignore everything they actually do on the ground in favour of the proposition that you are bad and you are. You are morally blameworthy. Your life does not matter your your prospects. Do not or your hopes in your dreams do not matter because you are not part, because playing revolutionary brigade, because you like a dog they actually caught the car. They know what to do with it. It really is these rules, if tom ford, and timothy charlemagne and eo see if ever caught the car and the instituted socialist revolution. Apparently so ardently see it may be quite unhappy with the result most ardent communists in the united states, who never lived under communism and most ardent capitalists in the united states have. There is a for that reason, the cuban expertise, come to the united states and they understood the evils of communism, while all the communists in the united states were born in the united states, went to our top universities and an again it comes down way that they are going to to re in green still reinforce. Own sense of moral superiority is to crap on you bringing and it comes out in you think they do, it really does take, for example, covered power. They will get to that in just one moment, because marathons are still trap.

That is, is throughout the administrative state. First last week by denouncing authoritarian vaccine mandate, meant force all companies over a hundred employees, either mandate back or test their employees for covered at least once per week. Can you heard already not gonna, do that a daily work? we think the federal government has the authority to do any of this. For this we could face up to fourteen. Dollars for every single violation which could destroy us, which is why we are taking them to court and we are calling on you for europe. Support. If you join us as it anywhere member right out will begin. The resources we need to take, despite all the way to the supreme court, if necessary, in our daily work outcome, slash subscribe, use code do not comply check out for twenty five percent of amerika have been far too willing to see their freedoms to authority and bureaucrats in the name of public health. Enough is enough, so please stand with us at the daily, where with the rights of all american citizens? in listening to the largest fastest growing concern? pakistan, radio, show in the nation because folks are your moral betters. It matter what they they can do whatever they want. They can be as bad policy as they want to be. As lord as you are, the target. All that matters folks, wonder where the populist sort of revolt from a came from an f you, where it came from a camera americans. Looking at stuff like this and saying declaring yourselves our moral better. Here is a giant orange pulsating middle finger to you and by the way a person was unrepentant capitalist. I would add that on the part of companies actually find charming and always known. Charming was the fact that trump was like yeah, a cat listen guess what great stick it more of this, please it but again for all of these vote. Once have declared themselves be morally fit and you the unfair it doesnt matter whether the policies that they are actually in charge of now ails you, members of congress, woman, not a singer, not a wrapper not an actress a congresswoman carolyn maloney is a congresswoman. And there being treated and fitted as though they are celebrities, but our politicians are actually in charge of policy, may have noticed the relationship between policy and politician right. They come from the same route exactly are they allowed you? and yet? the answer is anything so long as the victimizing. There are people, so equip the came out yesterday, mrs commerce secretary geena raimondo talking about the new vaccine. And she says you know what it really matter if a few little people lose their jobs overall, there will be job gains, is that all of the vaccinated will feel comfortable to go back to work and we can reopen the economy if we do these batsy manage. But you lost your job, because you are natural immunity and monitor the vaccine? well, tough beans for you, because we are the elect concerned at all. This could have a worse impact on the workers shortage we currently have people will quit their jobs. I am not saying not. You know. We need to get. We have challenges in this economy right now supply chain workers shortages, young people still afraid to fly people reach back to work all to me alleviated. If everybody gets yes, there is a challenge. Now people not going back to work, a lot of tat is because people are afraid to go back to work, ok such a lie. The reason the people are free to go back to work is because of you because of the media in europe. We want, where to go back to work, red states, people back to work in florence in backward for months, i will i mention this because it remains a the z policy riven this is not in actual disease driven gap. It is a perception gap. Once again, the bat needed should be fine, going back to work. The vaccine are highly successful, but you guys are attempt. You drive a wedge between americans on vaccination status and willingness to get the vaccine is on. Two viable by the science, because everyone now the ability to get the vaccine, but you care if somebody loses their job, you care. If your was demanded means that if we exceeded your request, daily wire, might have to fire forty fifty employees what happens to them? because they are the baddies, you see their bad and good, the reason we know good is big is not me, your policies, not because your policies are actually good or right or fair or rights based. No, because you good person and we know a good person because of who you are in opposition to. And consistency is of little consequence year begins. Your position at random, because, once you are a member of the elect than theirs thing you can do they get a kick out of the elect, except to sympathise with the unaware. That is all that happens right. So, for example, we yesterday a great incentive, doktor factory, second best offered america africa for joe biden. He can only said now for mandates when it comes to air travel. Now this is completely anti scientific. Air travel has not been a vector of dread of disease. This entire time, if epithet answers on the plains, at the beginning of the pandemic, when there were no vaccines available. There was very transmission on planes and better safer monoplane than you were other area, because the ventilation. The cdc sazen. Much by the way, the cdc it and we are surprised to learn that planes really were not being used as doctors of transmission. Now you ve anthony you basically saying we want to ban in entire group of people in the united states from being able to fly and travel your basically what are putting on a no fly list like your terrorist. If you get vaccinated, why per se now it aims to protect the vaccinated, not kidding you. This is their idiotic, the common interest we desire yesterday, a couple of years later, into the united states actually tweeted out, vaccinating yon vaccinated, increasing our testing and masking and protecting the vaccinated and this pandemic protecting the vaccinated you nor protects the vaccinated, the vaccine. Why called vaccinated? i was protected, in it. My antibodies cadet after that in protecting the vaccinated is an attempt by the against figures, voucher, saying something completely anti scientific and supposed to believe him, because after all he has to science, i what that, if you want to get on a plane and travel with other people, that you should be vaccinated, why. Women in agony should be vaccinated generally, but why is it a precondition to travel jersey? why evaluated hundred exchequer factory sort that twenty nineteen and twenty nineteen, whose directly ass by rapporteur from bloomberg. So our masks a great of preventing disease. Twenty nineteen, prior to dynamic his answer exactly like jargon and the best way for me to prevent getting an infectious disease and having to have you as my doctor, is what, wearing a mask now know through that somebody i can see the red maria sneezer cloth walk away. You avoid all the paranoid aspects into something positive, a good diet b. You smoke. I know i know you drink, at much so pretty good gets exercise. I know that you get as much exercise as you should then soccer anthony. You started twenty nineteen to be a member of the elect you have to do a doctor, anthony factory, says even in direct contradiction to. It is amazing. By the way we ve gone, this entire pandemic, been no systematic discussion of whether american should exercise that is kind of an amazing thing. You can be both vaccine and pro exercise which, by the way, would be the actual scientific position here the vaccines are good and also it is better not to be fat. Ok, it is better as a health matter not to be overweight. That does not mean there are people who struggle with it. But there are a lot of people were doing their exercise and not eating healthy. That is just a reality in united states. Whenever people talk about the health gaps in the united states for scandinavia, it goes way fatter than scandinavia is acts? are medical system socks is as our medical system fix the fact that many of us are gigantic, just a reality. It, but factories member. You have to listen to him and if you listen to him than your cast into the outer darkness and now, making it more more radical right, zeke emmanuel says be cast into the outer darkness. If you dont want to nastier or or vaccinate your small children now get the wondering where is it like their be some pretty exorbitant data on the lack of risk to choke? from this vaccine? because the lack of risk from covered is well substantiated? this point united states. None children under the age of eighteen who died in the united states from coal. It is four hundred and twelve course of a year and a half during this pandemic, as opposed to well over nine hundred fifty who died from pneumonia saint exact, varied of time here is tat here is a zeke emmanuel hover saying we need to actually mandate that small schoolchildren get the vaccine. Only forty percent of those kids, twelve to fifteen have gotten only vaccinated we really need that number to go away. Just to give you a contrast, adults between sixty five and seventy five who were so threatened before eighty five them are vaccinated. We need to really mandate, i think, twelve to fifteen year olds, the vaccine all on the contrary, is unbelievable? ok, when saying he just compared vaccination rates among twelve to fifteen year old, whom we are talking about. Maybe a couple. A few dozen debts, everyone here, but few dozen debts, the course of a year is comparing that two people and the rate sixty five which is everyone who died in the united states, is it is there have always killing the elderly me. Administration again. Confer the science is saying that everybody get boosters its own. Pvc has like nope. The cdc anna w echo are both again. We were not sienna, guys like we looked at the data and what we are saying is that evaluation had ninety five percent effectiveness. Again severe disease, promote delta and elsa. More than eighty percent effectiveness in protecting against infection from those variants they noted the wing antibody levels, necessarily correlate with a against severe disease because you got t sell and be so immunity right may eventually be needed, said scientists, but there could be risks if booster too, widely introduced too soon or too frequently, because it might create adversary and when you do too many fast you and yet the administration is rushing for with the sort of stuff and only if you, if you will note any of us, then you will be cast into the outer darkness and then you than that the bad people it is all about all about being a member of the electricity, a member of the nano act, and that is why our politics are so broken, and there getting fixed anytime soon, because the walter were issue of our time is whether you think your neighbour is a bad person. It is not the back saying it is not. It is not racial issues, it is not tax issues, it is none of that its whether you are oriented against the institutions of the country and are therefore part of shall then, while benefiting from it or if not, that is how we determine there is a reason why i mean that there is a pull. The just came may scott ass national and this is backed by other data when christians, santos ended. A pull last year is with eyeing something, and what this profound is that, fifty seven percent of democratic voters believe that supporters, donald trump are a serious threat to the nation. They literally believe that their fellow americans are a serious threat to the nation itself, that is supposed to say the taliban. Only forty four, democrats believe that the taliban are a threat to the country or believe that china is a threat to the country. I believe the defined the police activists are a threat to the country. Fifty six percent democrats, believed on vaccinated americans are a threat to the country again your vaccinated there not a threat to you. They only and present believe that russia is a threat to the country percent believe the donald took donald trump supporters are a threat to the country. Now, if you look at how none identifying voters rank these issues in terms of who they think is a threat to the country, not gnp not down in this, for the top threats, according to the independent voters, are in order. Taliban china defined the police activists on vaccinated americans, russia, donald support as illegal immigrants and socialist supporters and socialists are basically on par with one another. According to sort of independent voters can, but when you take a large percentage of country. Forty percent the and you say what makes you good or what makes you bad agreement with my dumb slogan on the back of my dress and anything that we aid together it is oriented against other people. I care if they lose their jobs their though there the baddies, then what you end up with
